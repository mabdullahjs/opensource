An arrow function in JavaScript is a more concise way of writing a function expression. It was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and provides a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions. Here's a basic syntax comparison:

Traditional function expression:
```javascript
const traditionalFunc = function(parameters) {
    // function body
};
```

Arrow function expression:
```javascript
const arrowFunc = (parameters) => {
    // function body
};
```

Arrow functions are especially handy for shortening code and maintaining a cleaner syntax, especially when dealing with functions that have a simple single statement body. They also handle the `this` keyword differently, which can be beneficial in certain contexts, such as in callbacks or when working with object methods.
