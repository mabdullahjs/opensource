## HTML and CSS

### HTML Questions

1. **What is HTML?**
   - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

2. **What are HTML tags?**
   - HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define the structure and content of web pages.

3. **What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration?**
   - It defines the document type and version of HTML being used, ensuring proper rendering by browsers.

4. **What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?**
   - Block-level elements take up the full width available and start on a new line (e.g., `<div>`, `<h1>`), while inline elements take up only as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).

5. **How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?**
   - Using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute: `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>`.

6. **What are HTML attributes?**
   - Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always included in the opening tag (e.g., `src` in `<img src="image.jpg">`).

7. **What is semantic HTML?**
   - Semantic HTML uses tags that convey the meaning of the content (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`), improving accessibility and SEO.

### CSS Questions

1. **What is CSS?**
   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.

2. **What are the three ways to apply CSS to a web page?**
   - Inline CSS (using the `style` attribute), internal CSS (within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`), and external CSS (linking to a separate CSS file using `<link>`).

3. **What is the box model in CSS?**
   - The box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree, consisting of margins, borders, padding, and the content area.

4. **How do you center an element horizontally in CSS?**
   - Using `margin: auto` for block elements with a defined width, or using `text-align: center` for inline elements.

5. **What is the difference between `class` and `id` selectors in CSS?**
   - A `class` selector can be used on multiple elements and is denoted by a period (`.`), while an `id` selector is unique to a single element and is denoted by a hash (`#`).

6. **What are pseudo-classes in CSS?**
   - Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`).

7. **What is the purpose of CSS Flexbox?**
   - Flexbox is a layout module that makes it easier to design flexible and responsive layout structures.

## JavaScript

### JavaScript Questions

1. **What is JavaScript?**
   - JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, such as interactive forms, animations, and user interactions.

2. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
   - `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared, `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared, and `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

3. **What are JavaScript data types?**
   - JavaScript data types include `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `object`, and `symbol`.

4. **What is the purpose of functions in JavaScript?**
   - Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a particular task and can be invoked as needed.

5. **What is an event in JavaScript?**
   - An event is an action or occurrence detected by the browser (e.g., clicks, keypresses) that can be handled using event listeners.

6. **What are JavaScript Promises?**
   - Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

7. **What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?**
   - The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents, representing the page so programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

Sure! Here are additional JavaScript questions for beginners:

### JavaScript Questions (Continued)

8. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.

9. **What is closure in JavaScript?**
   - A closure is a feature where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables even after the outer function has returned.

10. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**
    - `==` compares values for equality after type conversion, whereas `===` compares values and types for strict equality without type conversion.

11. **What are arrow functions?**
    - Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions and do not have their own `this` context.

12. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword?**
    - The `this` keyword refers to the object from which the function was called, providing a way to access the object’s properties and methods.

13. **What are JavaScript objects?**
    - Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, where values can be properties (data) or methods (functions).

14. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**
    - Destructuring is a syntax that allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

15. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**
    - Synchronous code is executed in sequence, blocking subsequent code until the current execution is complete. Asynchronous code allows other operations to run while waiting for long-running tasks to complete.

16. **What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?**
    - An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined, typically used to create a new scope and avoid polluting the global namespace.

17. **What is event delegation?**
    - Event delegation is a technique for handling events efficiently by attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage events from multiple child elements.

18. **What are template literals in JavaScript?**
    - Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions, denoted by backticks (`) and `${expression}` syntax.

19. **What are default parameters in JavaScript?**
    - Default parameters allow function parameters to have default values if no value or `undefined` is passed.

20. **What is the difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?**
    - `map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element, `filter()` creates a new array with elements that pass a test, and `reduce()` reduces the array to a single value by executing a function on each element.

21. **What is the Fetch API?**
    - The Fetch API provides a modern interface for fetching resources (e.g., network requests) and is based on Promises.

22. **What is local storage in JavaScript?**
    - Local storage is a web storage API that allows storing data locally in the browser with no expiration date.

23. **What is a callback function?**
    - A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.

24. **What are modules in JavaScript?**
    - Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

25. **What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?**
    - The Event Loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

26. **What is async/await?**
    - `async` and `await` are syntax for writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, where `async` declares a function as asynchronous and `await` pauses the execution until the Promise is resolved.

27. **What is the difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`?**
    - `call()` and `apply()` invoke a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, where `call()` takes arguments separately and `apply()` takes them as an array. `bind()` returns a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments bound to it.

28. **What is JSON?**
    - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines.

29. **What are ES6 classes?**
    - ES6 classes are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance, providing a clearer and more concise way to create objects and handle inheritance.

30. **What is the difference between `window` and `document` in the DOM?**
    - The `window` object represents the browser window and global scope, while the `document` object represents the HTML document loaded in the window.
