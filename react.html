        <h1>Introduction to React</h1>
        <p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page 
        applications (SPAs). It was developed by Facebook (Meta) and follows a component-based architecture.</p>
        
        <h2>History of React</h2>
        <p>React was initially developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, in 2011. 
            It was first used in Facebook's newsfeed and later in Instagram. In 2013, Facebook open-sourced React, 
            making it available to the developer community. Since then, React has evolved significantly with major updates, 
             the introduction of React Hooks in version 16.8 and concurrent rendering capabilities in React 18.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features of React</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Component-Based Architecture</li>
            <li>Virtual DOM for Efficient Updates</li>
            <li>One-Way Data Binding</li>
            <li>React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)</li>
            <li>Server-Side Rendering with Next.js</li>
            <li>Context API and Redux for State Management</li>
            <li>SEO Optimization Features</li>
            <li>Concurrent Mode for Better Performance</li>
            <li>Automatic Batching for State Updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Built with React</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Next.js:</strong> A React framework for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).</li>
            <li><strong>React Native:</strong> Used to build mobile applications for iOS and Android.</li>
            <li><strong>Remix:</strong> A full-stack React framework focused on performance and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Gatsby:</strong> A React-based framework for fast, static websites.</li>
            <li><strong>React 19 (Upcoming):</strong> Expected to bring enhanced performance, new hooks, and improved SSR capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Vite:</strong> A fast build tool optimized for React applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advantages of React</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reusable Components</li>
            <li>Fast Rendering with Virtual DOM</li>
            <li>Strong Community Support</li>
            <li>Easy to Learn and Integrate</li>
            <li>Supports Both Client-Side and Server-Side Rendering</li>
            <li>Flexibility to Use with Other Libraries</li>
            <li>Improved Performance with Concurrent Mode</li>
        </ul>
