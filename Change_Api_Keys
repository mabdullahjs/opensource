Title: Using a Class to Fetch Data from an API and Changing the API Key Dynamically
Introduction
In modern JavaScript applications, interacting with APIs to fetch and manage data is a common requirement. Using classes to encapsulate API interaction not only organizes your code but also enhances its reusability and maintainability. This guide demonstrates how to create a class for fetching data from an API and dynamically changing the API key used for requests.

Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Define the User Class
First, define a User class to structure the data fetched from the API:

"class User {
    constructor(data) {
        this.cat = data.category;
        this.desc = data.description;
        this.img = data.image;
        this.Rs = data.price;
    }
}"

The User class constructor initializes properties (cat, desc, img, Rs) based on the data received from the API.

Step 2: Fetching and Processing Data
Next, implement the dataresponse function to fetch data from the API and process it using the User class:

"const dataresponse = async () => {

    try {
        let data = await fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products");

        let response = await data.json();
        
        console.log(response);
         
        const updateddata = response.map(user => new User(user));
        
       
        console.log(updateddata); 
        
      
        return updateddata;

    } catch (error) {

        console.log("Unable to fetch data", error);
    }
};

 
dataresponse();"

Explanation of dataresponse Function
Asynchronous Function (async)

The dataresponse function is defined as an asynchronous function using the async keyword. This allows the use of await inside the function to wait for promises to resolve before proceeding.

Fetching Data from the API

Fetch API: Initiates a GET request to the specified URL (https://fakestoreapi.com/products).

Awaiting Response: Waits for the fetch operation to complete and stores the result in data.

Parsing JSON Response

data.json(): Converts the fetched data (data) into a JavaScript object (response) by parsing its JSON content.

Mapping Data to User Instances

Mapping Function: Uses response.map() to iterate through each object in the response array.

Creating User Instances: For each object (user) in response, it creates a new instance of the User class using new User(user).

Logging and Error Handling

Logging: Logs the entire API response (console.log(response)) and the transformed data (console.log(updateddata)) for debugging purposes.

Error Handling: The try-catch block catches and logs any errors that occur during the fetching or processing of data.

Return Statement

Return Data: Returns the updateddata array containing instances of the User class to the caller of the dataresponse function.
